# 🏛️ Project ODIN: The Linux of AI

> *"Democratizing Intelligence, One Parameter at a Time"*

## 🎯 Mission

Create a decentralized, sovereign, and accessible AI ecosystem that runs on consumer hardware without requiring billion-dollar datacenters.

## 📋 Phase 1: Proof of Concept

**Objective:** Build a 100 Million parameter model based on Mamba/RWKV architecture, trained exclusively on synthetic math & coding data, running in the browser via WebAssembly.

> "If this toy can reason, the theory works."

## 🧬 Core Philosophy

### Why Not Transformers?
- O(N²) attention is expensive and memory-hungry
- Mamba/RWKV achieve O(N) complexity
- Linear scaling = runs on consumer hardware

### Why Synthetic Data?
- No copyright issues
- No bias from web scraping  
- 100% verified correctness
- Focused on reasoning, not memorization

### Why Browser?
- Zero installation friction
- True decentralization (no server needed)
- Privacy by default (runs locally)
- Proves it works on weak hardware

---

## 🔮 Future Phases

- **Phase 2:** Distributed training via P2P swarm
- **Phase 3:** Scale to 1B+ parameters
- **Phase 4:** Multi-modal (vision, audio)
- **Phase 5:** Federated learning network

---

## 📜 Manifesto

```
We believe:
  - Intelligence should not be controlled by few
  - Privacy is a fundamental right
  - Knowledge should be free and verifiable
  - Small, efficient models beat bloated giants
  - The edge is the future, not the cloud

We reject:
  - Dependency on proprietary hardware
  - Black-box AI systems
  - Surveillance capitalism
  - Artificial scarcity of intelligence
```
